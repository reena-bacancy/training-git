ing your email address for a single repository

You can change the email address associated with commits you make in a single repository. This will override your global Git config settings in this one repository, but will not affect any other repositories.

    Open Terminal.

    Change the current working directory to the local repository where you want to configure the email address that you associate with your Git commits.

    Set an email address in Git. You can use your GitHub-provided no-reply email address or any email address.

    $ git config user.email "email@example.com"

    Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git:

    $ git config user.email
    email@example.com
